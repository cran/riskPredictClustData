  (1) simplify the function 'getScore' a little to drop the output 'id'

v0.2.0 created on March 21, 2018

  (1) change 'sid' to 'cid'
  (2) change 'uid' to 'subuid'
  (3) change 'value' to 'score'

v0.1.8 created on Feb. 28, 2018
  (1) sort simulated data by uid and sid
v0.1.7 created on Feb. 01, 2018
  (1) remove some unrelated intermediate outputs

v0.1.6 created on Dec. 28, 2017
  (1) In 'genSimDataGLMEM', set the default values: beta0=-6
  
v0.1.5 created on May 18, 2017
  (1) remove the input 'theta1' from the function 'powerCal'
  (2) update the mannual for 'powerCal'
v0.1.4 created on May 3, 2017
  (1) simplify code, e.g. reduce the number of calcuations for ci, di
  (2) renmae 'getFrame' to 'getScore'
  (3) drop some output functions. Keep only functions:
       genSimDataGLMEM, getScore, powerCal, riskPredict, riskPredictDiff

v0.1.3 created on May 3, 2017
  (1) add function 'genSimDataGLMEM'

v0.1.2 created on April 25, 2017
  (1) add summary.riskPredict and summary.riskPredictDiff 
      for 'riskPredict' and 'riskPredictDiff'
  (2) fixed a bug in 'genDat12': in paste statement, "\n" should be
      sep="" 
  (3) add output E.stat.Ha and E.diff.Ha
  (4) revised the construction of 95% CI for eta_c to make sure
      95% CI is within the interval (0, 1)
  (5) use 'cov' instead of 'cor', otherwise for some case,
      corMat in calculation Cov(A1, A2) will not be a correlation matrix
